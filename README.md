# Debatem

Debatem is a Rails application meant to allow groups of people to debate about decisions in a structured way.  Aside from just providing points of view, they must do so in reaction to other options, and provide claims, data, and warrants.

Possible uses:

* Helping management make decisions in a way that is transparent to employees.
* Training debate students.
